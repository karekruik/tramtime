### IoT for displaying public transport times



## What does it? 

Displays the time and line number of the coming next two public transport at a certain stop and going to a certain destination by using Google Directions API and Google Cloud Functions API. 

## Main Components

* Wemos d1 mini

* E-ink screen

* 18650 battery

* TP4056 charger

* Step up converter

* 3D printed enclosure


## Why Google Directions API?

I originally wanted to use a local public transport API (9292.nl) but they turned out to be not free. So I signed up for Google Directions API which gives you a free credit and free request (under limit) every month. 

## Why Google Functions API?

Google Directions API delivers back a json file. It is really long and I cannot parse it with Wemos d1 mini (insufficient RAM). Because I did not have a better dev board with higher RAM (e.g. ESP32) at the moment of developing this project, I went through with Google Functions API to parse this data. 

## What is included in this repository?

* Wemos d1 mini sketch (tested in Arduino IDE) 

* Python code for Google Functions API

* STEP and STL files for the enclosure (3D print) 

## Summary of the functions

* Step-up DC-DC converter (this component is not a must. I used it to get a longer run time)

### Software flow

* Wemos d1 mini connects to a prescribed WIFI
* Sends a request to Google Functions API (GFAPI)
* GFAPI gets the next two tram times and line numbers from Google Directions API (GDAPI)
* GFAPI returns the retrieved info back to Wemos d1 mini
* Wemos d1 mini parses this info and prints it to the E-ink display
* Wemos d1 mini goes to deep sleep and wakes up 5 minutes before the next tram time to check the times again for a fresh update in case of any delay
* Wemos d1 wakes up and this loop restarts


Foot note: I know it is an overengineered solution until I learn to do better.
